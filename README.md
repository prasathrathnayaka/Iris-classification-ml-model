# Iris Classifier API with FastAPI

This repository contains a simple API for classifying Iris flower species using a *RandomForestClassifier* from the scikit-learn library. The API is built with *FastAPI* and can make predictions based on four input features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Features

- *API Endpoints*:
  - /predict: Accepts query parameters for flower features and returns the predicted Iris species.
  - /: Root endpoint to check if the API is running.
  
- *Machine Learning*: Uses a pre-trained RandomForestClassifier on the famous Iris dataset.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following libraries:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/iris-classifier-api.git
   cd iris-classifier-api
   

2. Install the required dependencies:

   bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn numpy
   

### Running the API

1. After installing the dependencies, you can start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

   bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   

   - Replace main with the name of your Python script if it is different.
   
2. The API will now be running locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can access the API documentation automatically generated by FastAPI at:

   
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
   

### Usage

#### 1. Prediction Endpoint

You can make predictions by sending a GET request to the /predict endpoint with the following query parameters:

- sepal_length: (float) Sepal length of the flower.
- sepal_width: (float) Sepal width of the flower.
- petal_length: (float) Petal length of the flower.
- petal_width: (float) Petal width of the flower.

Example:


http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict?sepal_length=5.1&sepal_width=3.5&petal_length=1.4&petal_width=0.2


#### Response

The API will return a JSON object with the predicted class of the Iris flower:

json
{
  "prediction": "setosa"
}


#### 2. Root Endpoint

The root endpoint simply returns a message to verify that the API is running:


http://127.0.0.1:8000/


Response:

json
{
  "message": "Iris Classifier API is up and running!"
}


### Example Code (Python)

You can also make requests to the API using Python:

python
import requests

# Define the API endpoint and parameters
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict"
params = {
    "sepal_length": 5.1,
    "sepal_width": 3.5,
    "petal_length": 1.4,
    "petal_width": 0.2
}

# Make the request and print the response
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
print(response.json())
